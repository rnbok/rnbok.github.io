# about me
first-paragraph: I am a second-year master's student at <a href="https://www.kaist.ac.kr/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> KAIST</a>, in the department of Nuclear and Quantum Engineering. I conduct my research at the <a href="https://www.mirlab.kaist.ac.kr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Medical Imaging and Radiotherapy Lab</a>, being advised by <a href="https://www.mirlab.kaist.ac.kr/professor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prof. Seungryong Cho </a>.
second-paragraph: My research in medical imaging primarily involves applying <hightlight> Generation Models </hightlight> to enhance image quality, including high resolution, improved contrast and artifact reduction, while minimizing dose and scan time. My recent focus has been on developing <hightlight>Text-Image Multimodal Representations </hightlight> of medical concepts to help comprehension for viewers, particularly in large language model. 
research-interest: My research interest in <hightlight>Generative Models</hightlight>, <hightlight>Multimodal Models</hightlight>, <hightlight>Medical Imaging</hightlight>, and <hightlight>Natural Language Processing</hightlight>.
